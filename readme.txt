== Description ==
[SoundCloud Sound Competition ](http://lightdigitalmedia.com/wordpress-plugins/soundcloud-sound-competition/) has been created to let you host your own remix competition without thinking about storage space, it's all integrated with SoundCloud so that all remixes are stored there.

Just make your own app in Soundcloud and add the parameters within your settings and you are good to go. You can chose a database slug when a competition has come to an end and you want to start another one, this creates a new competition. The plugin uses [OAuth2](https://api.soundcloud.com/oauth2/) so your Soundcloud account details are not stored for the
plugin to gain access.

Also supporting Facebook secure voting and multi language.
